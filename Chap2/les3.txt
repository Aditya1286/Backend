MIDDLEWARAE
This is used for lose coupling they have the access in the middle to call some function and changes in between the processing the code 

This is the way we create middleware
code:
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    next()// if we not the call the next it will stuck in between never call the app.get/post
})
Some of the precreated MIDDLEWARAE are:-
1.urlencoded
2.JSONparse


If we change any changes in req and res it will show throughout the other middleware either in the GET/POST
