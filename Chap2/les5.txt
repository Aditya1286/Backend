Cookie Parser
we use this to set the cookie with the key value pair 
Syntax: res.cookie()
example: res.cookie("key","value",{maxAge:6000})


To read  the cookie we need to use middleware known as cookieParser()

 then if we want this to show the read cookie into server we can do this
 res.send(JSON.stringify(req.cookie));
 This will show the cookie in json format
